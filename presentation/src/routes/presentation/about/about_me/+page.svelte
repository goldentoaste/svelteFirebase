<h1 class="title">About me</h1>
<p>
    My name is Ray, I am on my last year at University of Alberta, and I am curently on internship
    at SAP doing cloud operations.
</p>

<p>
    My experience with Svelte and web dev started about 2 years ago, when I knew very little about
    web dev. I was trying to get a React app together for an hackathon, it worked but just barely
    and I didnt have a good time. And thats when I learnt about Svelte, this framework that is
    making lots of bold promises.
</p>

<p>
    For me, as a hobbist, I think Svelte's stream lined reactivity makes it actually enjoyable to
    use, so that I can focus on making my website instead of wrestling with the framework.

    slanders.
