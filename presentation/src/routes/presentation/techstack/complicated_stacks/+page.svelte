<h1 class="title">Some Common Stacks</h1>

<h3 class="title">MERN / MEAN stack (MongoDb, Expressjs, React/Angular, Node.js)</h3>

Is a common term being thrown around, but mostly because it has a nice acronym.

<h3 class="title">Alternative: Django fullstack, or Django api + Js frontend of choice</h3>

<h3 class="title">Or, go serverless with cloud functions?</h3>

A Big problem with "choosing" a stack is that realistically there are many more details to think about.

<ul>
    <li>Which database?</li>
    <li>Use an ORM? (object relation mapping)</li>
    <li>How is frontend communicating with backend? (RESt Api? GraphQL?)</li>
    <li>Live client server communication? (websockets?)</li>
    <li>How is all the server stuff going to be deployed?</li>
    <li>Frontend state manage systems? (redux? ðŸ’€)</li>
    <li>Component Library?</li>
    <li>Css preprocessor?</li>
    <li>And the list goes on...</li>
</ul>

<p>In hackathons, as hobbyists, its best to just keep it simple. We are doing an one off project, security and scalbility is not at all a concern.</p>
